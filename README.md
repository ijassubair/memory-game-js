it just a time pass game. there are 30 columns. when you click on each block it shows an image,and it fade away suddenly.you have to remember this image position.when you find same image in another column you have to click back that image and pairing.then you got 1 point.your each click will count to know how less attemt you do to complete this game.good luck.
